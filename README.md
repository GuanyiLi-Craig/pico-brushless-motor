# Brushless Motor Controller with Raspberry Pi Pico

The Brushless Motor Controller project aims to create a versatile and user-friendly solution for controlling brushless motors A2212/15T 930KV using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, Hobbywing Kkywalker 30A ESC and two buttons. By leveraging the power and flexibility of the Raspberry Pi Pico, combined with simple input mechanisms, this project offers an accessible and customizable motor control solution for various applications.

Key Features:

* Brushless Motor Control: The heart of the project lies in its ability to control brushless motors, offering precise speed and direction control for a wide range of applications, including robotics, drones, and electric vehicles.
* Raspberry Pi Pico Integration: The Raspberry Pi Pico serves as the central processing unit, providing the necessary computational power and GPIO pins for interfacing with the brushless motor driver and buttons.
* User Input with Buttons: Two buttons are incorporated into the design to enable user interaction. These buttons can be used to adjust motor speed. 

Assambling:

GPIO 13 - Button 1, speed up
GPIO 14 - Button 2, speed down
GPIO 15 - PWM, motor control

Power supply: Here I used 12v 12.5A 150W PSU. Lipo is recommended. 


Overall, the Brushless Motor Controller project combines the power of the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller with the simplicity of button inputs to create a versatile and customizable motor control solution. Whether used for hobby projects, educational purposes, or prototyping applications, this project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the world of brushless motor control with ease and flexibility.
